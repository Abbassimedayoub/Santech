    <section id="about" class="about">
        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>My journey with Santech started from my days as an operating room nurse, where I encountered daily challenges in managing medical supplies. The inefficiencies in tracking medication expiration, maintaining inventory levels, and managing patient records were not just cumbersome but also prone to errors that could affect patient care. Inspired to make a difference, I envisioned a system that would streamline these processes, ensuring safety and efficiency.</p>
        <p>Santech is more than just a capstone project for my first year at Holberton School; it's a personal mission to resolve the logistical hurdles that healthcare professionals face every day. Developed with the latest technologies in Django and React.js, this application is designed to handle the complexities of medical store management comprehensively. By integrating these systems, Santech helps medical facilities manage their operations more effectively, ensuring that healthcare providers can focus more on patient care than on administrative tasks.</p>
        <p>This project not only showcases my skills in full-stack development but also reflects my commitment to improving healthcare through technology. Feel free to explore the project's progress and the technologies used by visiting the GitHub repository linked below.</p>
